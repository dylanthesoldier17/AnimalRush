### Description
> This is a 3D RPG where the protagonist must save his town from hungry animals and people. This project is a spin off of one of [Unity's Learn platform lessons](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-2-basic-gameplay?pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0). I am working on this to demonstrate my capabilities as a unity developer.
